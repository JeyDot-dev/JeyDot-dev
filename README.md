### Maybe you are wondering what happened to my 20 or so repos. I simply decided to separate all of my pedagogic projects/school projects from the more personal or useful projects. You can find all of the projects I make for practice/learning at https://github.com/orgs/exercises-projets-pedagogiques/repositories
