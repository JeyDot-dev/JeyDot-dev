## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m currently working on [Transcendence](https://github.com/JeyDot-dev/transcendence), the last project of the 42 School common core.

I just installed Wakatime so houndreds of hours haven't been counted :(

[![JeyDot's WakaTime stats](https://github-readme-stats.vercel.app/api/wakatime?username=JeyDot)](https://github.com/anuraghazra/github-readme-stats)

I'm currently looking for a 4-6 months internship in either software engineering, network, sys-admin, or even devops/security :)
